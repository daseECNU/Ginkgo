 * necessary to change the corresponding avg() to sum(), and find count() column
 * id, if there isn't count(), append additional count(*) at the end of
 * aggregation_attrs[]. so the schema is also changed, but it doesn't matter.
 * and all count() = count(1) = sum(1).
 * Note: kReparAndGlobalAgg node isn't implemented because it's inefficient by

 * TODO(FZH) due to count(*) is different from count(expr) for NULL, and now the
