/**
 * @brief Generate the delete filter plan, which filters the deleted tuple based
 * on the del table.
 * @details The delete filter is very similar to the EqualJoin operator fills
 * the join statement. It joins the base table and the deleted table together to
 * filter out the deleted tuples. The return of the delete filter is different
 * from that of the equal joinï¼Œ and its output schema is the base table, and
 * output tuples are all from the base table without tuples in the delete table.
 * Basically, the partition key in the delete table may be the same as those in
 * the base table. In such cases, all the delete filter will be executed on
 * local node. If not (in cases when users set the partition key of the base
 * table to the be the key not of the row_id), the delete filter have to add the
 * exchange operator as its child. The delete filter use the equal condition on
 * the row_id to filter out the deleted tuples. If exchange operator is added,
 * the delete table will be repartitioned.
