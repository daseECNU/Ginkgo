#  Welcome to Ginkgo

Ginkgo is an open source system for concurrent data ingestion & data analysis running on a distributed in-memory cluster. Ginkgo extends traditional parallel database technologies with runtime dynamic execution as well as high throughput concurrent data ingestion to achieve real-time data analysis together with data which are being ingesting right after newly produced, as well as provides expressive and optimizable programming interfaces and at the same time efficient and scalable execution.
